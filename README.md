# SkillBridge-Job-Course-Recommender

In today's competitive job market, finding the right career path and identifying skill gaps can be overwhelming. Our project, Career Navigator, is a powerful AI-driven tool that helps users discover top job opportunities, analyze their skill gaps, and receive tailored course recommendations to upskill efficiently. This system leverages TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to provide personalized career insights and learning pathways.

How It Works
1.Job & Career Recommendation with Skill Gap Analysis

The user inputs their current skills (e.g., Python, SQL, Machine Learning).
Using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity, the system compares the entered skills with a database of job descriptions to calculate a matching score for various job roles.
The system identifies the best-fit jobs based on similarity scores and highlights missing skills required for each role.
The user receives a skill gap analysis, showing which skills they lack and need to learn to qualify for their desired roles.

2.Course Recommendation Based on Skill Gaps

After identifying missing skills, the user can enter them into the system.
The system scans a course dataset and recommends the most relevant courses using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to match course titles with the missing skills.
Courses are ranked based on relevance, course rating, difficulty level, and student enrollment, ensuring the best learning options are suggested.
